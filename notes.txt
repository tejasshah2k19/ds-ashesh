------------------------
we have chain class, that stores an id and rank.
we need to create n numbers of chain in block. 
starting id is 6. 
next id is depend on current id. 
if current id is even then divide current id by 2 and u get next id 
if current id is odd then multiply current id with 3 and add 1 , u get next id.

repeat this process until u get id = 1 

what is rank ? 
rank is the position of chain it starts with 1 
and increase by 1 in every chain. 

you also need to take care that max chain in 1 block is 49. 


**must use linked list 
**we have chain class that act as node 
**block class act as caller , so all head and other stuff u have to put inside block. 
**to create chain u can use recursion that is  plus point++
